# GaggoLeetCode
Gaggo's personal Leetcode Practices. I doubt anyone will find these but in case you do, hello! Feel free to look at my code, make jokes at me and probably cringe how bad these will be. Like Gandhi always said, you gotta code bad to be good, bro.

## Potential for Collaboration and Innovation
I really don't know how public repos work, there's really nothing valuable here but if you just wanna use this repo as a way to practice doing something like forking or whatever, feel free! My options are probably weird so idk if there's even a possibility for you to comment or anything hah, though I suppose I do like living on the edge.

## License
Do whatever you wanna with my code, it's probably messy and not-at-all helpful anyway... Although if it actually does some good, feel free to drop me a comment or a question and I'd be happy to answer! (if it's even possible haa)
